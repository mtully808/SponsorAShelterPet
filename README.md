# Sponsor a Shelter Pet! #
Created with: animal shelters/rescues, the animals saved and the community who stands behind them, in mind - this app provides an easy & fun way for each party to benefit from the other!

> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Summary ##
  There are 3 different customers for this app - what does it provide each of them & what's the benefit?
  1. Animal Shelters/Rescues
      * What does this app provide this customer?
          * A place to upload details about each shelter pet they take in, including: photos, description of personality, tricks, favorite things to do, scale of energy level, and scales for how comfortable they are with other animals, kids, males, females etc.

      * What benefit does customer experience as a result of this app?
          * The ability to easily upload information about the animals so that designated volunteers can easily add to animal profiles & a quick, widespread dispersement of a particular animal's information into the community.
          * Also generates income to care for the animals because everyone who signs up to sponsor a pet will pay $5/month/animal to receive weekly updates.

  2. Community Who Stand Behind Shelters & Animals
      * What does this app provide this customer?
          * A place to easily see updates on their local shelters' pets (see what's included above), and then go one step farther by being able to choose to sponsor a pet for $5/month.
      * What benefit does customer experience as a result of this app?
          * When a person chooses to sponsor an animal they would in turn receive weekly notifications on what their sponsored pet learned/did that week & pics of them each week, which they could then share across social media and brag about 'their' sponsor pet.

  3. Animals Saved by the Shelters
      * What does this app provide this customer?
          * They will receive more exposure as their sponsors brag them up on their social media.
      * What benefit does customer experience as a result of this app?
          * Each animal being frequently featured and shared across the communities social media can only lead to improve the adoption rates and get all these wonderful animals into their forever homes sooner.


## Problem my App Solves ##
  This app helps to solve the persistent problem of trying to increase adoption rates.

## Solution my App Provides ##
  My app makes the sharing of individual shelter animal information easier for the shelters, more fun to engage in by the community & includes a sponsorship element so the community actually feels invested in the outcome of 'their' chosen animal while the shelter gets more funding - it's a win-win-win.

## Quote from the Creator ##
  "Animals provide endless happiness, comfort and joy to their owners - the quicker each of these wonderful souls can find their forever home the better off our world will be!" -Mikka Tully

## How to Get Started ##
  1. Download the app
  2. Browse your local shelter's adoptable animals
  3. Select animal(s) to sponsor
  4. Log in to save your choices, and set up your profile
  5. For $5/month/animal you will receive weekly updates on what your chosen pets were up to that week :) All proceeds go to the shelter to care for the animals.

# Sponsor a Shelter Pet!
Welcome to my very own web-app, thank you for taking an interest in my code! Helping animals is very near and dear to my heart, so thinking up this idea and working on the app has been pure bliss! I took this app from idea to a proof of concept in only 48 short hours. However, I don't plan to stop working on it, so the form you see now may have more hours of time invested than my initial 48 hour time-constraint. Sponsor a Shelter Pet is a Javascript library used to help increase: shelter funds, sponsor's happiness, and adoption rates! Peruse the below topics to aid you in getting started working with this repo.
***

## Using this Repo
You will find inside a breakdown of how I organized, created, and designed each feature of my Sponsor a Shelter Pet web-app. My folders are a good starting point to gain clarity into the organization and structure of my app. Within these folders is where you will find the code and styling related to the individual components and the features of these components.

## Getting a Copy of this Repo
If you haven‚Äôt already, please fork the repository on GitHub and clone your newly created repo down to your computer (then comes the fun part‚Äì exploring & learning)!

## Installation
Use the package manager npm to install all necessary dev dependencies for our repo ‚Äì run the following terminal command: `npm install`
To make development easier I have:
  * Added nodemon as an npm start script. To automatically restart the node application when file changes in the directory are detected, run the following terminal command:`npm start`.
  * Added webpack development mode as an npm start script. To automatically have webpack watch for and bundle changes, run the following terminal command: `npm run react-dev`.
